// Write a program that reads an array of ints and outputs the length of the longest sequence in strictly ascending order. Elements of the sequence must go one after another. A single number is assumed to be ordered sequence with the length = 1.

// Input data format

// The first line contains the size of an array.
// The second line contains elements of the array separated by spaces.

// Example

// The input array is 1 2 4 1 2 3 5 7 4 3. In this case, the length of the longest sequence in ascending order is 5. It includes the following elements: 1 2 3 5 7.

// Sample Input 1:

// 10
// 1 2 4 1 2 3 5 7 4 3

// Sample Output 1:

// 5
